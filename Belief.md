I will voluntarily avoid referring to specific cases in this document so that the conclusion can still be applied to religion as a whole no matter the minor irrelevant differences. 
If you need more specific example look at what religion and religious people say, and what they do, and see for yourself how my critic will inevitably apply.


# What this book is and is not about
This book do not aim, to explain how some phenomenon have been proven to be wrong. Because there is already enough book and information on the specific explanations of each of those topics. The information is already there for those who
Take the time to study and understand it.

I don't need to repeat what have already been explained clearly and his easily accessible information.

I am not trying to explain why we know things. But rather why some people can't accept that we know things.

Why some people try so hard to stay in denial of reality?

Why they keep misunderstanding not understanding and keep believing in things even themselves know to be false?

Why some people can't see that their core belief clearly contradict them self. Why do they still actively choose to believe in lie even when with simple basic logic they can be easily disprove?


# What is Atheism
Atheism disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God or gods.
We need more definition then, if you believe that no god exist, you are an atheism, so far so good, if you don't believe and only notice that there is a lack of reasonable proof and so you refuse to take position on the topic, are you an atheist? If you are against the very premises of religion and faith regardless of the existence of paranormal entities, are you an atheist?
It their no word that would be define as the sum of
Anti-belief, anti-religion, anti-bullshit, anti-illogical, anti-delusion, anti-lies?
Yes there is, it's called being __reasonable__! If people were not so illogical and unreasonable, religion would long have been gone, it would most probably never been a thing in the first place, if people simply called out its dishonesty.
The only reason why it is still a thing in the so called __Modern world__ is only the result in our inability to apply rigorous standard on those so called __controversial__ topic. 

People desperately want to believe in the impossible, the unreal and the magical, but the difference between sanity and insanity is the ability to distinguish these fiction from reality.

## God
If there is a god, it’s not the one from any religion. It’s something else, but as a general concept describing an entity responsible for the origin of event that formed our universe, then the answer is for now at least, we don't know and, we can’t know.

Even if such a being existed, it would not explain its origins, and it would mean that our reality is by default a form of simulation inside another reality, maybe reality is just a dream in another being head, again for now, we don't know and, we can’t know..

## Religions

B.I.B.L.E - Book of Intolerance Bigotry and Laughable Explanations.
Need proof? Just take look at this book called __The Bible__ and see for yourself how accurately this definition apply.
True religious freedom, is freedom from religion. 
Science is nature's truth, religion is mankind's deceit.
Religion have historically been the single most influential source of mass delusion to plague humanity.
You need proof of the impact of this mass delusion? Denial of the theory of evolution for one! But in a more general view, the denial of most scientific fact, 
For several hundred thousand of years while ignoring every time in history when these arguments have been proven wrong, and ignoring the fact that 
Since their inception none of them have been proven right! The unscientific push that religion still exercise to this day, on education in some region of the world is unthinkable.
So many attempt by religion to undermine the very concept of knowledge, since if we can't know anything, they can't know how delusional and wrong they actually are.
They are exempt from the standard that we as a society have establish to prevent lies, trickery and abuse.
This is what I mean by mass delusion, they flourish under an absolute immunity to every standard of valid knowledge we have, they are sometimes even immune to some law that we have established as a society.
Some people even deny that their religion is a religion, some people will even fool them self into believing that their belief are fact, and once again this is all result of delusion. 

## Creationism

There is no better example of narcissism then to think the world has been made for you or a group you’re a part of.

Hell and haven are just the most basic form of carrots and sticks based manipulative behavioral conditioning.

## Faith 
Knowledge is demonstrable.
Fact are provable.
Hitchens has phrased the razor in writing as "What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence."
Three most dangerous word in the English language "Just have faith."
The only things that require or desire your faith, is something trying to fool you.

Faith equal gullibility.

Faith is the most unreasonable position it is possible to have, because it is an assertion of unreasonable conviction which is assumed without reasons and defended against all reason." Aron Ra

Religion result in growing fanaticism, illogicality, irrationality and fantasy sometimes __fantasy of purity__ or self-importance.

Its delusional egocentrism reinforce by a strong unconscious alter ego that is mistaken for a presence of divinity or ultimate truth, with disregard for reality, facts, logic and reason? 

Morals exist independently of religion and despite religion, religion only distort moral, include antiquated views and too often discriminatory idea.

Religious belief and organization are based on deep rooted fallacy, its incoherence, contradiction and falsehood at its core, so how could it not be a bad thing? Some religion warn their follower of some Evil entity lurking in the shadow, but religions are evil entity with a societal immunity to act in daylight.

I doubt it is wise to hope to find any credibility in such confused mess.
Doubt is religion biggest fear, because people could learn to think for them self, and that’s no good for a business of lies deceit.
But I don't have to point out every contradiction to make my point, I don't even have to name one, I just have to clarify that
Their position is not based on logic.
At first most religious will try to deny that, but when cornered with logic, they will
Inevitably admit that their view was not based on logic and will not change based on logic. How could such a position not be dishonest?

Most cognitive bias are heavily involved in faith and religious belief. Understanding and accounting for these bias, is an important step in escaping these deception.

# Belief & objectivity

Those who believe god exist are wrong, just like those who believe god does not exist. The important denominator here is, “Beliefs” 

We do not have any reason to believe either of those declaration, and so we should not, just like with any declaration based on beliefs and not evidence, and even worst when those belief are presented as if they were fact, despise being completely baseless. 

No one has to be indoctrinated into believing in science and
Because no one has to believe in science, we simply need to understand the principle at its core.

The same way i understand how a ruler work, so i don’t need to believe in its measurement...

The same way i don’t need to believe in math or programming, with enough of a general understanding and logic, you can just understand how it work, without having to rely on faith.

For that without demonstrable fact there is no truth,
Fact need to be verifiable, otherwise we would give charlatan, the greatest tool for deceiving us.

There is multiple definition for "truth" but the way I come to use the term is for "that without fact there is no truth" and fact need to be verifiable otherwise we would give charlatan the greatest tool for deceiving us.

We need to have strict standard on what we accept as true otherwise nothing can be known.

Some religious people have the following attitude
: I don't understand science, therefore science is wrong. 

The entire religious concept is based around belief, and belief can be armful since they are based on nothing and are subject to bias and manipulation.

To every programmer that toyed with simulating natural selection, genetic algorithms and neural network or even just played with Conway game of life... would understand that complexity can arise from simplicity. From chaotic randomness can arise order and function?

So many people have try to undermine the theory of evolution, so many study have been made so many book written then it's a disgrace for the human species that some people still don’t understand it, or even play wishful ignorance.

This is not a book on proof of evolution, they have been written and tested by more competent people then me.

Most of the argument i have heard against evolution comes down to this kind of logic: logic: Adults don’t come from children because we’ve never seen a child go to bed and wake up the next morning as an adult.

And the theory still hold up to this day, which mean that so far we can consider it fact. When new information on the topic will arise that goes in a different direction will start to talk about possibilities, but so far no such information has appeared after all the research done on the topic.

## Christianity 
I will often take christianity as an example in this text, because it is the religion i am the most familiar with, and it's probably one of the easiest to debunk.

Internet comment i found:
"I just don't want to be a slave to sins, I’m fighting every temptation that come my way in the name of Jesus Christ AMEN"

My answer:
And you need Christianity for that? You know the Christ as described by the bible is just a mythological character right?
Except that in real life the only power of faith is to manipulate people with it, really bad for a society, should be avoided. It’s a form of willing ignorance and naivety. Faith is the narcissistic reaction to the unknown, even when that unknown can be known. Faith has no need for truth or rational in fact it work better if you’re a fool who has no standard on how to think. Faith is fuel for religion which is the worst thing to have happen to this world, they are organization that specialize in using faith to manipulate. Worst they indoctrinate the young with method similar to hypnosis and brainwashing, religions are all just synonymy for sect and cult, they all think their religion is right and all others are false without having more reason then the other to believe so.

Christian belief keep being re written to fit new narative, god was once vangfull and a big asshole, so they splited him into two persona with one of them being 
represented in the devil.

Same for Jesus Christ, their is some pasage where this all loving being turn some kids into stones, you might try to make excuses for these infoherence, religion often does, but the truth is way simpler, it's plain old human bullshit.

Why would some fool themselves in believing in the unbelievable?

Why because of beliefs and faith.
All belief are faith based and all faith is blind by definition. So people who use those term already admit
To willingly ignore reality in favor of conviction.

You cannot have a good view of reality if you keep your self
Blind to the fact. To the measurable quantifiable demonstrable truth that have been and are still tested and revised to be accurate!

If you deny all of this then, we cannot prove anything!
And if that was the case, then we do not have a reality. If everything is a lie and there is no way to tell lie from truth or to verify anything then we live in a delusion.

I do not believe that, i know that, and i can prove it, by simply bringing said definition, which will be included in this book.

This book does not try to disprove any specific religions, there is too many of them, it would be a never ending struggle to individually disprove them. I might mention some of the currently the most spreading. 

For most of the topics i will mention in this book, the fact mention, have been discovered and known since centuries ago.
And since it's not new information, it is irrelevant to the reflection contained in this book, since they can't be included due to most needing to be contained in entire book of their own, to not leave place to misunderstanding.

Some of those topics simply can't be resumed in a few sentence, without making them incomplete.

Despite that some clearly deny logic and reality in favor of old fairy-tails and a shared delusion based on lie asserting baseless statement as though they were true.

## Agnotology 
If I had to categorize this book, it's not about atheism, science, or even religion, I would put it in the
Agnotology category.

Agnotology is the study of deliberate, culturally-induced ignorance or doubt, typically to sell a product or win favor, particularly through the publication of inaccurate or misleading scientific data. More generally, the term also highlights the condition where more knowledge of a subject leaves one more uncertain than before.

Quotes
Let’s start this book with these numerous great quotes from Carl Sagan I found
Online.
(Carl Edward Sagan was an American astronomer, planetary scientist, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, and science communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation.)

“I don't want to believe. I want to know.” 

“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.”

“If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.”

“My view is that if there is no evidence for it, then forget about it. An agnostic is somebody who does not believe in something until there is evidence for it, so I’m agnostic.”

“You can't convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it's based on a deep seated need to believe”

Why no also take a look at some from Aron Ra
(Aron Ra is an American author, podcaster, and atheist activist. Ra is the host of the Ra-Men Podcast and a regional director of American Atheists. He had previously served as president of the Atheist Alliance of America and ran as a Democratic candidate for Texas' District 2 Senate seat.)

“No god worthy of worship would be associated with such character flaws as vanity, jealousy, vengeance, or wrath. God should be above such deadly sins and would not be encumbered by them.”

“Most reject the more repugnant or indefensible dogmas while still holding onto some core belief. Many believers will proudly describe themselves as "reasonable" or "rational" based on how little of their religion they still embrace versus how much they now reject. I think it's funny when people realize that the less you believe the more reasonable you are, but they stop before they reach the logical conclusion.”

“Christians think they're oppressed when they're not allowed to oppress others.”
(This apply to most, if not all other religions as well.)

“I would sooner damn myself to Hell than be forced to serve the insufferable despot that the Bible portrayed God to be. In”

“We are born atheist and we remain so until someone lies to us.”

This book will mainly be in a quotes by quotes format, because
To my opinion it make the information more concise pleasant to read
And easier to digest.

# definitions
Here some definitions:

What is a scientific theory?
A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world and universe that can be repeatedly tested and verified in accordance with the scientific method, using accepted protocols of observation, measurement, and evaluation of results. Where possible, theories are tested under controlled conditions in an experiment.[1][2] In circumstances not amenable to experimental testing, theories are evaluated through principles of deductive reasoning. Established scientific theories have withstood rigorous scrutiny and embody scientific knowledge.
A scientific theory differs from a scientific fact or scientific law in that a theory explains "why" or "how": a fact is a simple, basic observation, whereas a law is a statement (often a mathematical equation) about a relationship between facts. For example, Newton’s Law of Gravity is a mathematical equation that can be used to predict the attraction between bodies, but it is not a theory to explain how gravity works.[4] Stephen Jay Gould wrote that "...facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts.

What is the scientific method?
The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation. It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are principles of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.

What is a hypothesis?
Hypotheses is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "theory" are often used anonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research,[1] in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.

What is a cult?
n.	A religion or religious sect generally considered to be extremist or false, with its followers often living in an unconventional manner under the guidance of an authoritarian, charismatic leader.
n.	The followers of such a religion or sect.

What is a religion?
n.	The belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers, regarded as creating and governing the universe.
n.	A particular variety of such belief, especially when organized into a system of doctrine and practice.

What is a soul?
n.	A part of humans regarded as immaterial, immortal, separable from the body at death, capable of moral judgment, and susceptible to happiness or misery in a future state.
n.	This part of a human when disembodied after death.

What is faith?
n.	The assent of the mind to the truth of a proposition or statement for which there is not complete evidence; belief in general.
n.	Specifically Firm belief based upon confidence in the authority and veracity of another, rather than upon one's own knowledge, reason, or judgment; earnest and trustful confidence: as, to have faith in the testimony of a witness; to have faith in a friend.

What is a sect?
n.	A group of people forming a distinct unit within a larger group by virtue of certain refinements or distinctions of belief or practice.
n.	A religious body, especially one that has separated from a larger denomination.
n.	A faction united by common interests or beliefs.


What is belief?
n.	The mental act, condition, or habit of placing trust or confidence in another.
n.	Mental acceptance of and conviction in the truth, actuality, or validity of something.
n.	Something believed or accepted as true, especially a particular tenet or a body of tenets accepted by a group of persons.

## fact

As a matter of fact:
The Earth is an irregularly shaped ellipsoid.
The Earth rotate on itself at around 1500km'h at fix velocity depending on the cosine of your latitude.
Circumference of the Earth is around 40,000 kilometers.
The Earth rotate around the sun.
God as described by religions does not exist and could not exist.
The soul as described by religions does not exist and could not exist.
Religions are cults, Religions are sect.
Atheism is not a belief system
Science is not a belief system 
Science and Atheism are not Religions
Outer space is NOT full of water!


Fun fact:
We do share a common ape ancestor with chimpanzees. It lived between 8 and 6 million years ago. But humans and chimpanzees evolved differently from that same ancestor. All apes and monkeys share a more distant relative, which lived about 25 million years ago.

The story of Noa Arch no matter how false it may be might hold a good moral if you look at it from the right perspective, no matter how mighty and superior to other animal you might think of yourself, where all in the same boat in this story.

## spiritual egocentrism 
No creature has been created FOR us.

Animal indeed are devoid of souls, since soul itself does not exist!
It was a made up explanation for phenomenon that we at the time did not understand.
And when you try to explain what you don’t understand you either fooling you self or attempting to fool others.

Contrary to some belief, we are not superior in every way to every other creature quite the contrary, in most cases we are only superior in a single way, and it's due to the exceptional development of the frontal cortex of our brain. that's does not even mean where smarter than other animal, just that this single specific aspect of our brain which allowed us to do so much, took priority in our evolution over other aspect of the brain, aspect where other animal are more developed then us.

For example when it comes to fast visual recognition chimpanzees brain beat ours without doubt, and that's just one of many similar example. When it comes to the fact this narcissistic egocentric illusion of human superiority over other, is just wrong. Even some insect have better biological design in some aspect. For example we would probably get less injury if we had an exoskeleton like many insect have, compare to the meet bag design we currently do have. Also calcium is not the best material to make bones from. And those are just the first example that comes to mind. Not all religion deny evolution but most do so i taught clarifying this might be a good start.

## respect
I have always been taught that you need to respect other’s belief,
But what if they are actively armful, objectively wrong. 

I mean what god has believing in something did actually bring to us?
Either we know something or we don’t, believing is a presumptuous way of having conviction in something we don’t know, and that can’t ever be good.

We should try as much as we can to avoid believing, accept what we don’t know, and accept what we know, we can have taught and opinions but we should not fool are self in believing in them as if they were more than that, either those taught and opinion are confirm beyond reasonable doubt and have become fact, or they are just taught and opinions.

Belief is nothing else then the assumption that we know something we don’t.
But belief left unchecked can easily turn into denial.

If someone believed something really strongly all their life, how could you present to them a reality where those belief prove unfounded?

There is multiple poison to having beliefs and yet so few if any benefits.

The biggest lie of religions is that we need faith and belief.

And that we need to accept faith and belief of others.

## Deception
To believe is to deceive.
Deceive one self, or one another.
Religions are tool to manipulate the masses and keep them ignorant and naive,
There is no exception to this rule, they act like an intrusive virus
Spreading and infecting society and corrupting people mind with lie and denial of reality, it as a perverse effect on society, it is
A toxic concept that many where told to accept as if it deserved some sort
Of immunity.
Religion invented faith as an excuse for people to believe in the unbelievable, with standards to appraise the validity of affirmation that are nonexistent.

Even belief itself is the act of sharing a thrust, be it baseless or not, in something be it true or not.

Thrust need to be earn otherwise it is just nativity with confidence.

Knowledge is the enemy of Faith.

A theory is a fact with some amount of missing information, belief is missing information presented as fact.

Some deny that their religion are religion, some call it spirituality instead as if it wasn’t just another synonym for a religion.

If you want to understand the concept of recursion listen to the argument of 
a religious person trying to defend his belief from reality.

Why don't we convert the mega churches into homeless shelters?
The interesting thing with science is it's true whether you believe it or not.
You want more atheists. Make Christians read their damn book. 
Isaac Asimov: “Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived"
God or not, evolution is still a fact and the bible is still wrong.

## Hypocresy
What if I said this?
Yes, I do have proof that God does not exist. It is perfect and irrefutable. You cannot see it or detect it in any way. You cannot deduct it from the laws of logic either. You might claim that I do in fact have no such proof. But you have no proof that I don't and if you did I would simply dismiss them, without further consideration. 
Sound familiar? It’s called faith and it is the most disingenuous and dishonest approach you can have on any topics, it's not an argument, it's the lack thereof.

Faith is a poor substitute for thinking.

A Charlatan greatest tool is faith.

The art of deceit is dependent on the on the will to believe.

It's easier to believe lies than understand the truth.

The religious believer last weal argument:
"One day you will find out"

This is based on nothing, it's simply a meaningless threat, they them self-have been conditioned to fear.

We are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.

If the supernatural dipped its hand in the natural world, it would be dripping in physics

But to be a believer, you don't have to know anything. About anything.

Accepting evolution does not mean you have to reject religion, but truly understanding evolution should give you some serious doubts about the validity of religion.

The good thing about science is that it's true weather or not you believe in it.
-Neil deGrasse Tyson

Protestants killing Catholics, Hindus Killing Sikhs, Muslims killing everyone else

At some point every religions worship a book, not a deity.

Why would an all knowing, all powerful God need humans to do anything for him? He can do it himself with zero effort AND have it done correctly, rather than trusting fallible humans who will almost certainly fuck it up.

I am of the opinion, if God want it done, it WILL be done, therefor if it is NOT done, God doesn't want it done.

You see someone who you think God wants dead, ask yourself is that person dead? If the answer is no, then clearly god wants that person to be alive, or he doesn't care enough to smite him. Now, please stop killing people in the name of God.
The idea that a god is omnipotent and all powerful and still need petty human to do is bidding sound like a great contradiction.

If religion want to claim their bases are definitive. Then they must claim that reality itself is frequently inaccurate.

Believe those who are seeking the truth; doubt those who find it.

At least when religion where created they tried to give people explanation for concept no one could explain at the time, which is bad enough already, but now that we do understand those concept those outdated made up explanation are even more wrong and more outrageous!
## Mythology vs Reality

Genesis 1:6-7 (New King James Version)
"Then God said, “Let there be a [a]firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” 7 Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so."

Outer space is NOT full of water!!

When the book of your religion claim to be perfect you don't have to prove its all wrong, to disprove it. You just have to prove that a single element of it is, which is not that hard to do, when most of it and probably all of it, is.

Trying to prove something that is unprovable require no effort to be disproven.

Pretending to know something that can't be known. Make you not only a liar but a bad one at that.

Believing in something that has already been proven to be false, is just waste of time. At least if you’re going to believe in something regardless how dishonest and illogical it may be try to believe in information that we haven't already proven or disproven.

If it has been proven there is no need for belief, it's a truth.
If it had been disproven there is no need for belief it's a lie.

Like the old proverb said: 
When you assume you make an “ASS” of “U” and “ME”.

# What do we need religion for?

Religions did not invent values, and people can have values and ethics without them, in fact it is easier to share the best values from religions mention without the religious aspect of it.

Values exist on their own, and in fact are better that way.
"Respect other" for example seems like something we can all agree on without all the exception that religion add on top of or following the statement. 

And you should be able to follow those value for better reason then fear of a potential most often not correlated divine threat that can apparently be avoided if you repent hard enough after the fact.

It is not only possible to ask our self-deep philosophical question without religion, it might be the only way to do so.

Nothing important need religion, and the ego is no exception.
In fact if all the resource wasted on religions, where spend making the world a better place, the world would be a better place.

the value of religion are not based on reason, for example the promotion of "abstinence instead" of "sex education" by some religions only lead to more teen pregnancy in the area where those beliefs where majoritarily taught, this is not an opinion this is a fact, an observation that can be shown with statistical analysis. Yet religion do not care about the outcome of the lie they tell. If they did they would stop affirming belief that are actively making life worse for those believing them.

If the pope really cared about helping the poor, he would not be sitting on a 20 feet tall golden chair while some are starving to death.

As long as we do not reject those hurtful organization, humanity will be in a never ending idiocrasy. Where people are taught tolerate intolerance, from group that want the freedom to deny others freedom.

We should not need to sugar coat facts.

Your consciousness comes from calculation, that result from an electric current that follow neuronal path, similar to the small logic gates inside your computer, a better example would be a virtual neural network. But to understand how this work you need to study the topics and the topic does not contain much easy concept to grasp. But we do know it's not due to a soul? All the task that are attributed to the soul, are just process of the brain that have already been explain, there is no trace of the influence of such a thing. 

We cannot transfer our consciousness to a computer, we will never be able to do such a thing. The issue comes from the definition of a "transfer" but when computer will have enough memory and power we could be able to “copy” the configuration of a person brain. There is no missing ingredient, we just don't have a container big enough to contain the recipe.

Your action are so much dictated by your neuronal path that using simple electrode we can predict them!

I don't know much about the biology of the brain, its complex, but do know a lot about programming and simulating things.

I have programmed Virtual world and universe. Virtual creature that have genome and evolved, neural network that can solve problems without guidance, I have simulated the same law of physics that we have in reality using the exact same mathematical formula to achieve the exact same result. This helped me comprehend how those phenomena actually occur in a way that would have been impossible to most human just 20 years ago. I am not saying this is for everyone, but this is a way I found to play around with those concept that gave me a deep perspective on those topics.
If we could not know these thing like we do, no man would have landed on the moon, and if you believe that, that’s a topic for another debate, and you would first need to test that hypothesis and analyses the result instead of believing blindly.

One person on itself cannot know as much on everything that a person can by specializing on a single topics, this is why we have experts that spend their life studding specific topics, and to discredit their expertise in favor of baseless belief and assumption is the paroxysm of arrogance and narcissist.

Not to say that we cannot question expert if done adequately or be skeptical of any declaration they make. The issue is to refute theme not because of potential bias or disprovable fact but because of mistrust of experts in general or because their conclusion do not align with our view of the world, that is what i would describe as a despicable attitude.

You can't know everything, but the more you know, the less, you believe. At least that's how it works, if you’re not a completely delusional personnel in constant denial of what you know.

Less than one percent of philosophers are religious.
Why that might be? Maybe because when you start to analyses things and think deeply about them you and up realizing that some things make no sense! But that's just my view on what could be a potential explanation for those statistic.

"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies." - Nietzsche

"You cannot very well reason with someone whose basic line of argument is that reason doesn't count."
Isaac Asimov - The Judo Argument - April 1975.

Here are the big differences between science and religion.

Science: here is the evidence, what conclusion can be draw from it?
 Religions: here is the conclusion, what evidence can be find to support it? What evidence needs to be suppressed so it won't be questioned?

# Religious mindset
When science is proven to be wrong, the information is embraced and science grows.
When Religion is proven to be wrong, the information is buried and people are banished, imprisoned or killed.
Argumentation without argument, has been studied a lot with the different type of bias, accusation and loop holes that a person might use to refuse to admit that they were wrong or that they lost an argument.

Fact do not make excuses, faith does.

Argument for belief are often Argument from ignorance.

A common bias logic of god’s believer can be resume to this argument: Look at this puddle here. How could the hole be the exact shape of the water here if it wasn't designed that way?

Saying it’s your truth or it’s my truth in an argument to defend a point is meaningless it’s a bad substitute for saying you believe, and beliefs have nothing to do with truth!

If you are going to pretend that no one care about something, I can’t wait to know how you collected the opinion of everyone! To arrive at this conclusion.

Something greater than the observable and measurable fact, is another way to say here’s a delusion i would like to share with you, it exist it’s called imagination, it goes beyond reality and should not be confuse with it.

"Mass propaganda discovered that its audience was ready at all times to believe the worst, no matter how absurd, and did not particularly object to being deceived because it held every statement to be a lie anyhow."
Hannah Arendt, the Origins of Totalitarianism

Religions are propaganda.

Beliefs are weaknesses, Religion is the most efficient way to exploit those weaknesses.

Some say that it’s Belief in the value of money that give it its value, does that mean that Belief is some time necessary? 

Religion as they are if what they believed was to be true it would be even more suspicious.
In most religious mythology there is a god of lie a god of trickery and deception.

If a god of lie would start a religion what would be its core principles? Faith and beliefs, Because if you want to start a religion around your lies, what you need is people who have faith in what you claim, people ready to beliefs in those lies. 

So even if the mythology of those religion where to be true, they would most likely have been created by the evil they fear the most.

A good benevolent honest god like being would not need you to believe or have faith in anything.

Because religious people are delusional doesn't mean they are bad, they just assume to know what can't be known, and prefer to "believe" and have "faith" which is to quotes the Oxford Languages "spiritual apprehension rather than proof." it's a form of ignorance, and by that I mean no insult, I mean only to define the word I use clearly in the right context. Christian who pretend they Know X or that the Bible is remotely factual are either bullshiting you, them self, or both... with all due respect. Have a good day I know this was harsh but feel free to rebuke in the comment if you disagree with this conclusion. As to my personal opinion I don't see any benefit to religion, but I do see a lot of side effect of having shared disillusion reinforce by dogma and peer pressure. Any organization that require to be blind to logic, facts and reality in favor of mythology or spiritual fantasy is unhealthy and should not be as widely tolerated as it is... but hey we still have fast-food, alcohol and Tabaco on store shelf, if Humans knew what was good for them, we would know it be now...

Religions are meme (by definition), one that spread delusion maybe, but one none the less. 

### Definition of meme:
```

It's religions that I despise, but religious peoples, I only have pity for them.

Faith is like having confidence in something's without sufficient reason to... would that be basically the same as being naïve in a way? 

Every religion is based on some form of ego centrism, be it that a powerful being care about them or that the world turn around them in a way, that would take me a lot of faith/naivety to not question such interesting claims, they often fool them self into believing in mythology and fantasy story  as if they were history or reality, but this is just trying to be part of something special something extraordinary but the problem is that sometime reality isn’t extraordinary enough for some people so they need to make them self believe in these magical tails, I am a skeptics of all religion and belief system that require that you make yourself believe in disillusions that are baseless and in contradiction with reality. Which is to say all religion and spirituality. 

It is a plague that has affected our society for too long, if we ever hope to live in a true modern society we cannot have such idiotic organization spreading ignorance to the masses exploiting the hope of the desperate and the mind of the young’s.

Indoctrination and dogma of religious/spiritual kind of the sorts should only be a thing of a past era, that we look upon asking our self how could humanity once been so foolish.

Sadly our world is still infected by these harmful nonsensical manipulative belief system, 

One of the most despicable lies of religion that it use to defend itself, is its claim that it spread value and benevolence and ethics, but these things exist outside of religion and are less bias when taken outside of dogma so this argument is complete bullshit, i have nothing against the good value that can be sprinkled in religion text but no one need religion to share these value.

Religion is undoubtable a virus that affect logical thinking.

They shoved eggs back into chicken in 1906 with Jesus eminent return written on them, why? To fool each other’s! That’s how sick some of those religious folks can be. Am not generalizing some of them are simply naïve ignorant gullible fools who believe in crazy impossible illogical bullshit that contradict reality. 

Most Religion pretend to preach loves, at least when they’re not actively spreading hate, they preach loves however condition may apply, eligibility may vary, based on your area, race, sexuality or belief's, have faith and do not read the fine print for more details amen.

Religion is a f*cking lucrative business, your selling bullshit and in most place you don’t even get taxes or go to jail for doing so!
I i didn’t had morals or a care for the future of mankind i would jump on that opportunity to make myself richer on the back of delusional desperate people.

Imagine how narcissistic and egocentric and pretentious one must be to think THEY __knows__ there is a form of life after death, and without any evidence required! And they expect us to share their belief? 

When people cannot be reason with and have been indoctrinated into lies to the point of refusing to accept any other perspective. it is sadly too late for them.
There is nothing a logical person can say to reason with an illogical unreasonable person.

Faith is unreasonable, it is blind. 

Spirituality and religion depend on people basing their perception of reality on willingful ignorance and and abstract feelings rather than fact.

In no argumentations "I just know it." should be seen as a valid argument.

I talked with people who knew less about their own religion and belief then i did, and yet they still tried to feed me its lies?

People invent their own god, they create it as the encapsulation of their own view and opinions sometimes combine with some amount of indoctrination, they use 
Their own god as an excuse for their view of the word. If they are racist, homophobic, sexist, it will be what their god preach, I never seen a believer disagree with their god. They all know what their god want, because it's simply an alter ego. It’s sad to see they don't even realize it.
What they call god, is nothing but an alter ego of them self, of course they can feel it!
People can be indoctrinated and condition into a state of complete delusion and a complete denial of reality this is the science of manipulation and brainwashing people, and it is a science that have been perfected by religion trough human history.
In conclusion, religiosity is associated with poorer reasoning performance during tasks that involve cognitive conflict. These effects may reflect learnt cognitive-behavioral biases toward intuitive decision making, rather than underlying abilities to understand complex logical rules or to maintain information in working memory. The effects are consistent in two large cohorts and robust across sociodemographic variables.
