# Open_politics

Introduction
Here we will establish how politics was, is, and what it could be. What would be the closest thing we could get to a utopian political system. never forget that utopie is verry close to distopy and that often both are cut from the same cloth. none system could please, all but what system could leave the most people content, reduce death, and improve well living as much as to balance the right and freedom of all. This page is for deep analisis of political ideology with historical example. How could a "perfect" scociety be build?

Here we analyse what worked and what faild in every political system, and we ask why, and how it could be implemented, improved.
Here we suggest new aproche, idea and concept, that could be realistically put in place at least in theory.

I am more then open to your feedback, contribution, and soon to your conversation.
Be open minded avoid prejudice or pre conceived idea and may the world keep improving.
