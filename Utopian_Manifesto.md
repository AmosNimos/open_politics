Must of the Utopian according to my self.
First thing to know is that no utopie can be trully described with words, our language are flawd and so will any ideology we express trough them. bu this is just mear suggestion.

A universal world wide language. the key to solving conflict is often in communication, which is harder when both side of a conflict do not understand each other, esperento had this goal but failed, english almost succeded for now at being an international language but not necesserly for good reason. the language must be quick and easy to learn and avoid eception, it must be practical for everyday use and more technical needs. and finally should not be built on any individual culture but rather on practicallity.

when somthing is ineficient and has been proven out of any doupt as ineficient it should be changed.
i still use a qwerty keyboard, because of stupid tradition, when it come in the way of progress tradition need to be cutoff.

human are not the solution for utopia every society rulled or built by human can only become a dystopie and never a utopie, since a perfect scociety cannot be built and run by imperfect, fundamentally illogical being.


## Rent on Communism
Communist failed mostly because it never was a thing, 
their was only tyranny and totalitarian government, 
far from what Vladimir Ilitch LÃ©nine offered, but dead man dead man tell no tails... 
and now what people take for "communism" is just another historical dictatorship that contradict the true aim of communism.
Totalitarianism could only be beneficial for the greater good when a machine will be ruling,
without all the human flaws compromising the integrity of the system.
Anarchy on the other end aim at removing power hierarchy making us all truly equal in theory, 
democracy is another system we never trully had, since every pseudo democratic system is rigged to the bones,
who know what a true democracy would be like, not that the majority is often right like the book "Democracy in America by A De Toqueville" explain.
finally as long as human be human, and human are flawed by nature, system based on them are subject to human nature and human error. 


> I will also suggest manuscript and books on these subject and i am more then open to your contribution to this project, 
i cannot know everithing by my self, and could not, should not, theorise of a idealist system without outside feedback.
