# Introduction
Here we will establish how politics was, is, and what it could be.
What would be the closest thing we could get to a utopian political system.
never forget that utopie is verry close to distopy and that often both are cut from the same cloth.
none system could please, all but what system could leave the most people content, reduce death, and improve well living as much as to balance the right and freedom of all.
This page is for deep analisis of political ideology with historical example.
How could a "perfect" scociety be build?

## Rent on Communism
Communist failed mostly because it never was a thing, 
their was only tyranny and totalitarian government, 
far from what Vladimir Ilitch LÃ©nine offered, but dead man dead man tell no tails... 
and now what people take for "communism" is just another historical dictatorship that contradict the true aim of communism.
Totalitarianism could only be beneficial for the greater good when a machine will be ruling,
without all the human flaws compromising the integrity of the system.
Anarchy on the other end aim at removing power hierarchy making us all truly equal in theory, 
democracy is another system we never trully had, since every pseudo democratic system is rigged to the bones,
who know what a true democracy would be like, not that the majority is often right like the book "Democracy in America by A De Toqueville" explain.
finally as long as human be human, and human are flawed by nature, system based on them are subject to human nature and human error. 


> I will also suggest manuscript and books on these subject and i am more then open to your contribution to this project, 
i cannot know everithing by my self, and could not, should not, theorise of a idealist system without outside feedback.
