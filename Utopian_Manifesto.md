## Rent on Communism
Communist failed mostly because it never was a thing, 
their was only tyranny and totalitarian government, 
far from what Vladimir Ilitch LÃ©nine offered, but dead man dead man tell no tails... 
and now what people take for "communism" is just another historical dictatorship that contradict the true aim of communism.
Totalitarianism could only be beneficial for the greater good when a machine will be ruling,
without all the human flaws compromising the integrity of the system.
Anarchy on the other end aim at removing power hierarchy making us all truly equal in theory, 
democracy is another system we never trully had, since every pseudo democratic system is rigged to the bones,
who know what a true democracy would be like, not that the majority is often right like the book "Democracy in America by A De Toqueville" explain.
finally as long as human be human, and human are flawed by nature, system based on them are subject to human nature and human error. 


> I will also suggest manuscript and books on these subject and i am more then open to your contribution to this project, 
i cannot know everithing by my self, and could not, should not, theorise of a idealist system without outside feedback.
